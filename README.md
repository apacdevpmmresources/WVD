# WVD :- Windows Virtual Desktop

COVID-19 pandemic made many organization to let their employee work from home. The main challenge for any organization is to make sure their employees are as productive as they are in office. This will include security, access to equipment,large number of users accessing VPN connection etc.

[Microsoft Azure Windows Virtual Desktop aka WVD](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/) is a service on Azure that could be one part of a COVID-19 response plan. With WVD, we no longer need to be concerned with the constraints of the physical hardware or a person's location.

In this blog post I will be using my MSDN subscription to spin up the WVD instead of my official subscription (as I am not an administrator). That's means I already have my tenant and AAD setup. Please [use this link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) to spin up a new Microsoft Azure Account. 

## Steps to spin Windows Virtual Desktop. 

        Step 1:- Setup a user account and assign role assignment

        Step 2:- Provision Azure Active Directory Domain Services

        Step 3:- Provision a Windows Virtual Desktop Tenant Creator account

        Step 4:- Deploy Windows Virtual Desktop in Azure


### Step 1:- Setup a user account and assign role assignment
